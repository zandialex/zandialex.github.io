    <p class="summary">I created an app for myself because I was getting tired of my camera roll filling up with photos of documents, posters, business cards, or anything I would need to reference later.</p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Huge amount of junk photos build up in the camera roll. Since it's so easy to take photos of things to reference later, camera rolls get full of pictures of posters, slides, and notes. These photos are rarely deleted and take up space.</p>

    <h2>Research and Observations</h2>
    <p>This idea was initially sparked from my own experience, but when I spoke with other people they had they similar problems in their workflow.</p>
    <p>In many cases people are walking past posters on campus and they take a photo of one that catches their interest. They could have stopped and typed in the details into their calendar but it's slow and actually looses information. Because taking photos is so easy this is often what people do. Also, usually multiple pictures are taken per session (for slides or notes) which become difficult to find later on.</p>
    <p>They needed something that was super easy to capture information with, but also easy to manage.</p><br>

<!--     <h2>Prototyping</h2>
    <p>After determining goals and the needs of the users, I made some paper prototypes.</p>

    <img src="../images/glance/prototypes.png" class="u-70-width u-img-center u-img-style"> -->

    <h2>Capture</h2>
    <p>The capturing flow was very important. Because this was such an unusual way to create reminders, it was important to educate users with good animations and a clear UI.</p>
    <p>When creating a new reminder, the camera is on by default and once you write what you want to be reminded about and press "Save", the todo is saved and takes a picture at the same time. You don't always need to write something because sometimes the image provides enough information.</p>

    <h2>Photo Groups</h2>
    <p>I realized that when people take photos of slides or documents, they usually take many photos in one session. So I designed a way to logically group photos together that also makes it easy to append new photos.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <img src="../images/glance/home_collection.png" class="u-full-width u-300-height">
        <small>Home screen with a todo collection</small>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <img src="../images/glance/collection.png" class="u-full-width u-300-height">
        <small>A collection</small>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>See What's Due</h2>
    <p>Large visuals and colors makes it easy to see what needs to be done. Often you don't even need to read the text to know what to do.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <img src="../images/glance/home_collection5.png" class="u-full-width u-300-height">
        <small></small>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">

        <small></small>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Testing Assumptions</h2>
    <p>I think the best products are ones that the designer wants to use themselves. Since this was a problem I had in my life, I am planning to release this into the app store soon. By doing this I plan to test the assumption of whether people will use photos as reminders, or will the ease of the native camera entry-point keep people from using the app. I am hoping that the benefits outweigh the negatives, and that the extra control and organization will encourage people to take photos with the app rather than the native camera.</p>
