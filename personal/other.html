    <h1>Interdisciplinary Work</h1>
    <p class="summary">
      Kik was often a sponsor of local hackathons so as an intern I had the chance to design some free notebook swag. These are some of the designs I came up with.
    </p>

    <h2>Industrial Design</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Vase ∙ 2015</p>
    <p class="subtitle">In my first year of studying industrial design, I was tasked with designing a vase. I designed a vase that easily allows for watering with a seperate entrace. Care was also put into the curves and angles.</p>

    <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
    <p>To make some notebooks more personal I had the idea to represent the city of the event on the notebook. However, this idea wouldn't scale very well with the amount of cities that could be added.</p>

    <img src="../images/other/eco.png" class="u-full-width u-space-b0 u-space-t90" style="">
    <p>The Eco Council was a group at my high school that discussed matters relating to environmental friendliness at school. I made a simple logo that can work with or without the logotype.</p>

    <p>We also made hoodies.</p>
