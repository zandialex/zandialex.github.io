    <p>I’m currently a 3rd year computer science major from the University of Waterloo. I’ve done a couple internships at places like Yelp and Kik where I’ve been a designer and an engineer. Before studying CS I was an industrial design major for a year. Leaving design school was one of the biggest decisions I've ever made but ultimately it was for the best. Although I always had a passion for design, I was also in love with tech, and as Steve Jobs famously said it is the combination of technology and the humanities that results in great things, or something to that effect.</p>

    <p>In my first internship I worked at a chat app startup called Kik Messenger. This was an amazing experience because I got to learn from some very talented people and work on impactful projects. I worked on social problems, primarily helping people express themselves better through chat.</p>

    <p>After Kik, I was lucky enough to do a design internship at Yelp. Here I learned the importance of experiments and iterating. At Yelp we often tested designs, learned from the data, iterated on them, and tested again. This was valuable to experience because it opened my eyes to the impact that a slight UI change can have on people's behavior. I also got to learn new prototyping tools like Framer, giving me greater control over a design vision and making me a better designer as a result.</p>

    <p>For my third internship, I returned to Yelp as a Frontend Engineer. I always felt that knowing how things work could only result in more creativity, so I decided to try something new and understand the tech behind things. I worked on creating reusable and modular UI components that were used across the mobile and desktop site. I’ve learned a lot from my time at Yelp and am extremely grateful for my experience there.</p>
