          <h2>iOS Share Extension</h2>
          <h3>Kik Messenger</h3>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="intro">I designed the Kik iOS app extension. Designed to be easy to use and focus on the content being shared. Since I was part of the content team I worked on ways to share content between users, and designing Kik's first share extension was a natural way to do that.</p>

    <div class="small_section"></div>
    <div class="horizDivider"></div>

    <h2 class="">The Goals</h2>
    <p>The goals of this project were to make sharing content with people and groups on Kik as simple as possible. In addition, Kik was releasing new bubble styles with cool content previews at the time so it also needed to work well around that.</p>

    <div class="horizDivider"></div>

    <h2 class="">Iterations</h2>
    <p>I explored a couple different iterations. There were three main iterations:</p><br>

    <div class="u-text-center">
      <div class='col-3 share_extension_it1' style="float:left">
        <img src="images/projects/screens/extension_alert_ui.png" width="90%" class="screen u-space-b4">
        <div class="medium_circle"><p>1</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class='col-3 share_extension_it2' style="float:left">
        <img src="images/projects/screens/extension_alert_ui.png" width="90%" class="screen u-space-b4">
        <div class="medium_circle"><p>2</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class='col-3 share_extension_it3' style="float:left">
        <img src="images/projects/screens/extension_recents.png" width="90%" class="screen u-space-b4">

        </p>
      <div style="clear: both"></div><br>
    </div>

    <div class="horizDivider"></div>

    <h2 class="">Final Product</h2>
    <p>Here's a prototype of the final design.</p>

    <div class="iphone_5s">
      <video controls loop>
        <source src="videos/share_extension_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
    </div>

    <div class="horizDivider"></div>
    <div style="clear: both"></div>
  </div>
  
  <div id="footer" class="">
